- It would be good to see the numbers of days for each temperature to better understand what a more "typical" day might be in each month.
- Looking at different years might  reveal some trends if a particular year had some weather events that other years did not have.
- Both datasets have outliers. It might be good to take these into considering when interpreting the data
